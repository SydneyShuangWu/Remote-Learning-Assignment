● git status
Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. Lets users see which changes have been staged and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

● git add
Used both for new and newly modified files. It takes a snapshot of the given files and stages the content in the index, ready for inclusion in the next commit.

● git commit
After contents are staged, users can permanently store them in the repository using git commit.

● git log
Shows users the information regarding the committed project history.

● git push [ Repo_name ] [ Branch_name ]
Used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.

● git remote -v
To show remote url after name. Must be placed between remote and subcommand.

● git branch
To create, list, rename, and delete branches in your repository. 

● fork
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repo allows users to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
